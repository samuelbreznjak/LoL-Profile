# LoL Profile

LoL Profile is a website where you can check your rank, match history and mastery points.

When the user enters his username and region, the website fetches data from [Riot API](https://developer.riotgames.com/) and then displays the data.

You can also check top 300 players on each server and see which champions are currently in free rotation.

This website was made with React and Styled components.

To hide api key, website uses netlify functions.
